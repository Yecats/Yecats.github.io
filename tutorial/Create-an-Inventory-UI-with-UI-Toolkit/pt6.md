Now that you have an inventory that looks decent and has slots, it’s time to make it interactable! Before we jump into how the event system works, it’s probably a good idea to review GameController, a helper script that came bundled with the starter project. 

`GameController` generates a small item database that has three items in it. Each item has a friendly name, GUID, icon, and “CanDrop” boolean. It also contains the player's inventory data and an `OnInventoryChanged` event that is called on `Start`, which the UI will listen for. You can find the script on the **GameManager** GameObject in the **Demo** scene.

## Add a hook for OnInventoryChanged
Before you can populate or interact with the UI, you’ll need to give `InventorySlot` the ability to hold and drop items. Add the following code to `InventorySlot`:

```csharp
public void HoldItem(ItemDetails item)
{
    Icon.image = item.Icon.texture;
    ItemGuid = item.GUID;
}

public void DropItem()
{
    ItemGuid = "";
    Icon.image = null;
}
```

If InventorySlot is holding anything, the GUID and Icon will be set. If it’s not, they’ll be empty/null. 

It is time to populate the initial view based on the player's inventory. Add the following to the end of `InventoryUIController.Awake`:

```csharp
GameController.OnInventoryChanged += GameController_OnInventoryChanged;
```

Add the following new method:

```csharp
private void GameController_OnInventoryChanged(string[] itemGuid, InventoryChangeType change)
{
    //Loop through each item and if it has been picked up, add it to the next empty slot
    foreach (string item in itemGuid)
    {
        if (change == InventoryChangeType.Pickup)
        {
            var emptySlot = InventoryItems.FirstOrDefault(x => x.ItemGuid.Equals(""));
                        
            if (emptySlot != null)
            {
                emptySlot.HoldItem(GameController.GetItemByGuid(item));
            }
        }
    }
}

```
Save your scripts and push play in Unity. You should now have three items in the player’s inventory!

## Add drag and drop behavior
A “ghost icon” will appear when the player initiates a drag event on an InventorySlot. This lets you freely move the image around the screen without worrying about any funky repositioning logic. Create the ghost image by going back to **UI Builder** and adding a new **VisualElement** as a child of **Container**. **Name** it **GhostIcon**. Set the follow styles:

1. **Position**: Absolute
1. **Size** > **Width & Height**: 128x128
1. **Visibility**: Hidden

![]({{page.dir}}/images/5-ghost-icon.png)

> Make sure that GhostIcon is the last child. Otherwise, it’ll appear behind some of the elements. You can set a temporary icon under **Background** > **Image** to see how it’ll render.

Add a reference to **GhostIcon** on `InventoryUIController` by adding a new global variable:

```csharp
//Global variable
private VisualElement m_GhostIcon;
```

Add this line to the end of `InventoryUIController.Awake` (or really just after you set m_Root):

```csharp
m_GhostIcon = m_Root.Query<VisualElement>("GhostIcon");
```

Since you are in `InventoryUIController`, let's wrap up adding the full drag/drop logic. Add two more global variables:

```csharp
private static bool m_IsDragging;
private static InventorySlot m_OriginalSlot;
```

Add a new `StartDrag` method:

```csharp
public void StartDrag()
{
    //Set tracking variables
    m_IsDragging = true;
    m_OriginalSlot = originalSlot;

    //Set the new position
    m_GhostIcon.style.top = position.y - m_GhostIcon.layout.height / 2;
    m_GhostIcon.style.left = position.x - m_GhostIcon.layout.width / 2;

    //Set the image
    m_GhostIcon.style.backgroundImage = GameController.GetItemByGuid(originalSlot.ItemGuid).Icon.texture;

    //Flip the visibility on
    m_GhostIcon.style.visibility = Visibility.Visible;
}
```

`StartDrag` is called by `InventorySlot.OnPointerDown` and its purpose is to, well, start the drag process. :D The first interesting bit of logic here is that the new position for `m_GhostIcon` is set via their style properties. By subtracting half of the height and width, you ensure that the m_GhostIcon appears center to the mouse. 

There are two more pointer events that need to be registered. Add the following code to the end of `InventoryUIController.Awake`:

```csharp
m_GhostIcon.RegisterCallback<PointerMoveEvent>(OnPointerMove);
m_GhostIcon.RegisterCallback<PointerUpEvent>(OnPointerUp);

```
Add the final methods for  `InventoryUIController` - `OnPointerMove` and `OnPointerUp`:

```csharp
private void OnPointerMove(PointerMoveEvent evt)
{
    //Only take action if the player is dragging an item around the screen
    if (!m_IsDragging)
    {
        return;
    }

    //Set the new position
    m_GhostIcon.style.top = evt.position.y - m_GhostIcon.layout.height / 2;
    m_GhostIcon.style.left = evt.position.x - m_GhostIcon.layout.width / 2;

}

private void OnPointerUp(PointerUpEvent evt)
{
    if (!m_IsDragging)
    {
        return;
    }

    //Check to see if they are dropping the ghost icon over any inventory slots.
    IEnumerable<InventorySlot> slots = InventoryItems.Where(x => x.worldBound.Overlaps(m_GhostIcon.worldBound));

    //Found at least one
    if (slots.Count() != 0)
    {
        InventorySlot closestSlot = slots.OrderBy(x => Vector2.Distance(x.worldBound.position, m_GhostIcon.worldBound.position)).First();
        
        //Set the new inventory slot with the data
        closestSlot.HoldItem(GameController.GetItemByGuid(m_OriginalSlot.ItemGuid));
        
        //Clear the original slot
        m_OriginalSlot.DropItem();
    }
    //Didn't find any (dragged off the window)
    else
    {
        m_OriginalSlot.Icon.image = GameController.GetItemByGuid(m_OriginalSlot.ItemGuid).Icon.texture;
    }

    //Clear dragging related visuals and data
    m_IsDragging = false;
    m_OriginalSlot = null;
    m_GhostIcon.style.visibility = Visibility.Hidden;

}
```

1. `OnPointerMove` is pretty straight forward - it’s just taking the latest mouse position and setting m_GhostIcon’s position to it.
2. `OnPointerUp` handles the logic for determining whether the player let go of the mouse while it was hovering over an inventory slot. You can easily check whether one `VisualElement` overlaps another by calling `VisualElement.worldBound.Overlaps()`. In this case, if slot(s) were found then they will be ordered by distance and the closest one will get the new item. 

> I highly recommend you take a bit of time to read about how UI Toolkit dispatches events, which you can do [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIE-Events-Dispatching.html). This will be especially important if you have multiple UI Documents in your scene.

### Trigger the drag process
Each `InventorySlot` will monitor for `OnPointerDown` which will indicate whether the drag event should be triggered. Register a new event listener at the end of the `InventorySlot` constructor:

```csharp
RegisterCallback<PointerDownEvent>(OnPointerDown);
```

Create a new OnPointerDown method with the following code:

```csharp
private void OnPointerDown(PointerDownEvent evt)
{
    //Not the left mouse button
    if (evt.button != 0 || ItemGuid.Equals(""))
    {
        return;
    }

    //Clear the image
    Icon.image = null;

    //Start the drag
    InventoryUIController.StartDrag(evt.position, this);
}

```

**OnPointerDown** will first make sure that the left button is pushed and that the `InventorySlot` is actually carrying an item. If it is, then it’ll call `InventoryUIController.StartDrag()`. Here’s the full list of the button to integer mapping:

1. **Left**: 0
2. **Right**: 1
3. **Middle**: 2

That’s it! Hit play and see your drag and drop in action:
