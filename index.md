## Why create another tutorial site?
The goal for many of the tutorials on this site is to teach fundamental concepts so that you can apply them to your game. In other words, they do not just show you how to create an item inventory or some other common game mechanic, but also dive deep into the underlying elements that make it up. Tutorials often have starter and final project files so that you can follow along. Some tutorials also have challenges at the end which are designed to help you apply the knowledge you just learned right away.
