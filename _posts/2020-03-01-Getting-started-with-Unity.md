### In this tutorial, you’ll learn about scenes, GameObjects, asset workflow, physics and more.

> You’ll need Unity 2019.3.6f1 (or newer) to follow along. This tutorial assumes knowledge of C#.

Making games is a fun, rewarding and humbling experience. While learning how can be very overwhelming, rest assured - it’s well worth the time! It’s very difficult to describe the feeling of seeing the look of pure joy on someone's face as they play your game for the first time. But you will know the feeling soon enough!

At the end of this tutorial you will have a game scene that has a ball roll down a ramp and into a bucket. Once it lands in the bucket, the screen will display text.
